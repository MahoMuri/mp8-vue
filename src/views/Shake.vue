              >This milkshake is good for your health as it is packed with
              proteins. To begin with, take one glass of milk (cold) and pour it
              into the mixer. Cut thin round slices of banana and put in the
              blender. Add one tsp sugar and cardamom powder to it. Give it a
              mix. Make sure that the mixture blends properly. Pour it in a
              glass and enjoy! You can garnish it with banana slices, whipped or
              fresh cream, and some chocolate powder.

              Mango; the fruit which we all love. For all the mango lovers, this
              milkshake is love. First of all, dice one or two mangoes. Pour one
              glass of cold milk into the mixer. Add the diced mangoes to it.
              Mix it. Then add one tsp (or more) sugar to it. You can add a bit
              of cardamom powder if you wish. Mix again. You can top it off with
              some chocolate shavings or dry fruits powder. If you have some
              mango ice cream with you, you can add one or two scoops of it on
              the milkshake as a topping.

              For all the nutella fans there, this recipe is for you. First,
              blend one cup of cold milk and two to three tsp of Nutella. Scoop
              vanilla ice cream and add to it. Blend again. Transfer the shake
              in a glass, topping it off with some whipped cream. Be careful not
              to add too much of nutella otherwise you wonâ€™t get the flavor of
              the vanilla. Balance is important.
